     be enough calls to process_buffer_aux to process everything in 
     the buffer, without us having to worry about termination proofs
     Note: one way to avoid the n is would be to show each dfa consumes
     at least one byte.

  (* This calls process_buffer. If that returns a None, then the
     program is not safe. If process_buffer returns a set of start
     addresses and known jump addresses, then we need to check that
     any address in the jump addresses which is not in the start addresses
     is aligned. This is done by taking the set difference of check_addrs
     and start_addrs, filtering check_addrs for all of the aligned addresses
     and then checking that the filtering process doesn't remove anything
     (Perhaps it's faster to do a filter on the negation of aligned_bool
     and then check that the result is empty).

     We also check that the number of aligned start_addrs
     is equal to the number of aligned addresses we should have if
     this code segment is loaded at an aligned address.

     The count of the number of aligned addresses could be done in the
     process_buffer loop, but I didn't want to complicate the logic
     there any more.  *)
